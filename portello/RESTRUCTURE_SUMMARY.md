# Project Restructuring Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Component Organization
   - Created structured component directories:
     - `src/components/common` - For shared UI elements
     - `src/components/layouts` - For layout components
     - `src/components/ui` - For UI components
     - `src/components/profile` - For profile-specific components
   - Moved components to their appropriate locations:
     - Layout components: `PortalHeader`, `PortalSidebar`, `LayoutShell`
     - UI components: `CartDrawer`, `ProductCard`, `ProductModal`
     - Profile components: `ProfileHeader`, `BasicInformationForm`, `AdditionalInformationForm`
   - Updated CSS modules to be co-located with components
   - Created barrel files (index.ts) for easier imports

### 2. Context Management
   - Moved CartContext from `src/app/context` to `src/context`
   - Created index file for exporting context hooks
   - Updated imports across the codebase

### 3. Types Organization
   - Created centralized types directory at `src/types`
   - Enhanced and documented types:
     - `src/types/store.ts` - Store/order related types
     - `src/types/user.ts` - User profile types
   - Added proper JSDoc comments to types

### 4. API Structure
   - Created a structured API utilities directory at `src/lib/api`
   - Implemented a robust error handling system with custom error classes
   - Created authentication/authorization middleware
   - Separated database operations into service layer:
     - Store service (`src/lib/api/services/store.ts`)
     - Orders service (`src/lib/api/services/orders.ts`)
     - Users service (`src/lib/api/services/users.ts`)
   - Added input validation for API requests
   - Standardized API response formats
   - Refactored API routes to use the new structure:
     - Store item routes
     - Orders routes
     - User routes

### 5. Hooks Organization
   - Created structured hooks directory at `src/lib/hooks`
   - Added feature-specific hooks:
     - Profile hooks (`src/lib/hooks/profile`)
   - Organized validation schemas with their related hooks

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Related code stays together
   - Consistent directory structure
   - Better import paths

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - More modular code structure
   - Easier to find and update components
   - Reduced duplication
   - Better error handling

3. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Simplified imports with barrel files
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase
   - Well-typed interfaces
   - Clear error messages

4. **Scalability**
   - Structure supports adding new features
   - Easy to add new components without disruption
   - Service-based architecture for API

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Component Migration**
   - Move remaining feature-specific components to appropriate directories
   - Update all imports

2. **Complete API Route Updates**
   - Refactor remaining API routes to use the new structure
   - Add comprehensive validation to all routes

3. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - Refine user permission handling
   - Add role-based access control

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Add unit tests for services
   - Add component tests
   - Add API integration tests

5. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation
   - Add JSDoc comments to functions
   - Create component usage examples
